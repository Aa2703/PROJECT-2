# Speech Emotion Recognition using Machine Learning

## Overview
The Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) project aims to classify emotions from speech audio using machine learning techniques. The system is designed to identify emotions such as happy, sad, angry, and neutral from audio data.

## Features
- Emotion detection from speech signals.
- Preprocessing of audio files including feature extraction (MFCC).
- Model training using various machine learning algorithms such as SVM, Random Forest, and CNN.
- Achieves high accuracy in detecting emotions from speech.

## Dataset
- The dataset used for this project includes audio files labeled with different emotions, such as the RAVDESS or EMO-DB datasets.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Librosa (for audio processing)
- Scikit-learn / TensorFlow / Keras (for model development)
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Feature Extraction
- MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients)
- Chroma feature
- Spectral contrast

## Model Architecture
- CNN for feature learning and classification.
- SVM and Random Forest as alternative classifiers for comparison.
